  "readme": "# Pandoc Preview\n\nRun your current file through Pandoc and preview the output within Atom.\n\nCommands:\n\n  * `Pandoc Preview: Show` will run the current buffer through Pandoc and show it in a new pane.\n\nThere are three config settings:\n\n  * `pandoc.cmd` which is the pandoc executable. This needs to be on your `PATH`.\n  * `pandoc.args` which are the command-line arguments to pandoc, defaults to `-s -S --self-contained`.\n  * `pandoc.languages`, a map of Atom grammar names to Pandoc input formats.\n\n## Limitations\n\n  * Only has HTML output at the moment\n  * Limited detection of input formats\n\n## Problems with PATH\n\nTo find the `pandoc` executable, ideally Atom should be able to find it on your `PATH`. Unfortunately, environment variables are a bit of an issue with GUI applications on OS X. Google it or see [Setting Environment Variables in OS X?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x).\n\nFor the `atom` command, you need to make sure Atom is loaded via env (which it isn't currently).\n\n    vim `which atom`\n\nChange:\n\n    open -a $ATOM_PATH -n --args --executed-from=\"$(pwd)\" --pid=$$ $@\n\nto:\n\n    env open -a $ATOM_PATH -n --args --executed-from=\"$(pwd)\" --pid=$$ $@\n\nNow Atom will have access to `PATH`, and can find your `pandoc` command.\n",
