Default is `title`\n\n### Save project\n`Project Manager: Save Project` in the Command Palette and write the title you want to save the project as.\n\n### Edit projects\nAll projects are saved in a `.cson` file which you can easily reach by searching for `Project Manager: Edit Projects` in the Command Palette.\n\n## Project Settings\n### `settings:`\nUnder settings you can set everything that you can have in the `config.cson` file which is what you see under the settings view.\nThe formatting should be as follows:\n```\n'settings':\n  '*':\n    'editor.tabLength': 4\n  '.source.coffee':\n    'editor.tabLength': 2\n```\nThe settings will be updated on change, but can also manually be done from the command palette with `Project Manager: Reload Project Settings`\n\n### `devMode:`\nWill open the project in dev mode. The API for this doesn't work perfectly though so if you try to switch to a project that is already open in dev mode, a new window will open.\n\n### `icon:`\nThis changes the icon displayed next to the project title in the list view. The icon is class-based, so you can either use the classes already provided by Atom like `icon-squirrel` or make your own class (target `:before`). The GitHub [octicons](https://octicons.github.com/) font is available to use, and most, if not all classes, just replace `octicon-` with `icon-`.\n\n### `template:`\nYou can specify a template in the `projects.cson` file to share settings between projects. The settings will merge so you can still specify project specific settings.\n\n### `group:`\nYou can specify a group that the project belongs to and then sort the projects list after group.\n\n### Example\n```\n'projectmanager':\n  'title': 'Project Manager'\n  'devMode': true\n  'group': 'Atom'\n  'template': 'coffeescript-template'\n  'paths': [\n    '/path/to/project-manager'\n  ]\n  'settings':\n    '*':\n      'editor.tabLength': 2\n\n'coffeescript-template':\n  'icon': 'icon-coffeescript'\n  'settings':\n    '.source.coffee':\n      'editor.tabLength': 2\n      'editor.preferredLineLength': 80\n```\n\n## Package Settings\n**Show Path:** Shows the path in the list view\n\n~~**Close Current:** Closes the current window before opening the new project~~ *(Currently disabled)*\n\n**Environment Specific Projects:** Uses `projects.[hostname].cson` instead of `projects.cson`\n\n**Sort By:** Sorts the projects list by selected option\n\n--------\n\n[![Paypal Donations](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=DR4XQWAZV6M2A&lc=SE&item_name=Project%20Manager&item_number=atom%2dproject%2dmanager&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted) a :beer: if you enjoy using the [project manager](https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager) :)","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager#readme","_id":"project-manager@2.1.0","_shasum":"88c9d192c75d9607332ede577ed6d0e8c54524bf","_resolved":"file:../d-11581-72759-7wz33s/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11581-72759-7wz33s/package.tgz"}
